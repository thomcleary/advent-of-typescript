// ðŸŽ…Santa Hides Behind Perf Review

// [ðŸŽ…Santa] Sadly, she's no longer a 10.

// [ðŸŽ©Bernard] Are we talking about the same thing??

// [ðŸŽ…Santa] Huh? Oh. Right, you were talking about the reindeer.

// [ðŸŽ©Bernard] Yeah, what were you talking about?

// [ðŸŽ…Santa] Nothing, nothing.
// So just tell them they'll get their raise when they can show some dedication to this business.

// [ðŸŽ©Bernard] The thing is they feel like they've more than accomplished that over the last 15 years since they last got a pay increase.

// [ðŸŽ…Santa] Tell them we'll review it during the next performance review.

// [ðŸŽ©Bernard, facepalming] And when is that?

// [ðŸŽ…Santa] When their performance improves!
// You think I just give raises to anyone who pulls a sleigh?
// This isnâ€™t charity.

// We need a type for a function that represents the performance review cycle.
// With this function in hand, perhaps ðŸŽ©Bernard will be able to convince ðŸŽ…Santa to take the reindeer's demands more seriously.

// Answer
type PerfReview<T extends AsyncGenerator> =
  T extends AsyncGenerator<infer R> ? R : never;

// Tests
import type { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";

async function* numberAsyncGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}
type t0_type = typeof numberAsyncGenerator;
type t0_actual = PerfReview<ReturnType<t0_type>>;
type t0_expected = 1 | 2 | 3;
type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;

async function* stringAsyncGenerator() {
  yield "1%";
  yield "2%";
}
type t1_type = typeof stringAsyncGenerator;
type t1_actual = PerfReview<ReturnType<t1_type>>;
type t1_expected = "1%" | "2%";
type t1 = Expect<Equal<t1_actual, t1_expected>>;
