// Jet Fuel Pricing

// While It's well known that with Christmas spirit at all-time lows, üéÖSanta has had to resort to using jet fuel to help power his sleigh.
// But in this economy, gas prices are through the roof!
// To help keep costs down, the elves came up with a plan to track the distance between each stop on üéÖSanta's route.

// The elves don't really understand "miles" or "kilometers".
// Instead, they just use the dashes they drew on the map to represent a unit of fuel needed to travel between locations.
// They've written out üéÖSanta's entire route as a string of locations separated by these markers.

// For example:
// "north_pole--candycane_forest----gumdrop_sea-------hawaii"

// This means:
// 'candycane_forest' is 2 units from 'north_pole'
// 'gumdrop_sea' is 4 units from 'candycane_forest'
// 'hawaii' is 7 units from 'gumdrop_sea'

// The elves need help building a type that will take their route string and calculate how much fuel is needed to travel between each destination.
