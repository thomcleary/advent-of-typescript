// Can Decades Of Wage Theft Really Be Corrected?

// [After decades of not raising the reindeer's pay, 🎅Santa suddenly and unexpectedly decided to raise their pay quite substantially. The reindeer are in shock.]

// [☄️Comet] It cannot be overstated enough how unlikely this was.
// How did he suddenly change.

// [💃Dancer] We all know what happened.
// It was 💋Crystal.
// She convinced him.

// [🌟Vixen] This is gonna make such a huge difference for my finances.
// I can finally pay off the debt I accrued from Battlefront II loot boxes.

// [❤️Cupid] You idiots.
// This is a win, but it's hardly putting us ahead.
// Have you forgotten about the 15 consecutive years of us being paid unfairly?
// All those lost wages will never come back to us.
// It's gone. We're only being paid a fair average wage now.
// We're not even paid well.
// 50% of reindeer make more than we do, and we're supposed to be happy about that!?
// We're the premiere reindeer the whole world looks up to yet we're paid like a substitute teacher elf.

// [💃Dancer] Well, irregardless, we've got an easy day in front of us.
// All we need to do is fix a small problem with the street lights in town.
// After that... might be time to throw ourselves a little party!

// [❤️Cupid] Is a party really appropriate given the circumstances?
// 💨Dasher, didn't your wife's hospitalization 5 years ago bankrupt you - have you recovered from that?

// [💨Dasher] Yeah, that is true, but look at the bright side!
// We're paid more now!

// [❤️Cupid] Do I have to get out my inflation calculator again for you nincompoops??

// [💃Dancer] Alright alright ❤️Cupid, we all heard you.
// Let's just fix the street lights, can we?

// [❤️Cupid] One day 🎅Santa is gonna come to his senses and realize what happened here.
// When that day comes, we're in for an exceedingly bad time.
// Mark. My. Words.

// Answer
const createStreetLight = <
  T extends string = string,
  Colours extends T[] = T[],
  Default extends Colours[number] = Colours[number],
>(
  colors: Colours,
  defaultColor: Default,
): Colours[number] => {
  console.log(colors);
  return defaultColor;
};

// Tests
import type { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";

const colors = ["red" as const, "yellow" as const, "green" as const];
//    ^?
type Color = (typeof colors)[number];
//   ^?

// red is a valid color, no generic parameters needed
const t0_const = createStreetLight(colors, "red");
type t0_actual = typeof t0_const; // =>
type t0_expected = Color; // =>
type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;

// one generic parameter is ok
const t1_const = createStreetLight<Color>(colors, "red");
type t1_actual = typeof t1_const; // =>
type t1_expected = Color; // =>
type t1 = Expect<Equal<t1_actual, t1_expected>>;

// @ts-expect-error (no generic parameters) blue is not a valid option
const e0 = createStreetLight(colors, "blue");

// @ts-expect-error does not accept two generic parameters, even providing a valid option
const e1 = createStreetLight<Color, "red">(colors, "red");

// @ts-expect-error does not accept two generic parameters, and blue isn't a valid option
const e2 = createStreetLight<Color, "blue">(colors, "blue");

// @ts-expect-error (with one generic parameter) blue is not a valid option
const e3 = createStreetLight<Color>(colors, "blue");
