// 🎅Santa Refuses To Use Threads

// [Conversation in the #bugs company Slack channel.]

// [🎅Santa] How do you hoofed halfwits manage to screw up something a toddler with a crayon could figure out?
// I asked for the simplest thing I could imagine and you still couldn't do it!
// If you had two brain cells to rub together you'd understand that only numbers or strings are valid route identifiers!

// [🌩️Donner] Please make a thead in this Slack channel, otherwise it gets too noisy and hard to follow.
// Also our Linear thing just made 3 tickets for each of your messages.

// [🎅Santa] I am old school, I prefer IRC-style chatter.
// I do not value these "thread" things and find them difficult to use. I'll never do it, myself.

// [🌟Vixen, in a thread] This isn’t 1997, Santa.
// Nobody cares about your IRC war stories.
// This is a company support channel with integrations designed to run the company better.
// How are you seriously against that??

// [🎅Santa] I'm not against that, I'm just against using threads in chat apps.

// Clearly we need to constrain our generic type a bit to only allow specific data types.
// 🎅Santa will probably also complain about that, but so it goes.

// Answer
const createRoute = <Route extends number | string>(
  author: string,
  route: Route,
) => {
  console.log(`[createRoute] route created by ${author} at ${Date.now()}`);
  return route;
};

// Tests
import type { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";

const oneMill = createRoute("🌩️Donner", 100_000_000);
type t0_actual = typeof oneMill; // =>
type t0_expected = 100_000_000; // =>
type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;

const two = createRoute("🔴Rudolph", 2);
type t1_actual = typeof two; // =>
type t1_expected = 2; // =>
type t1 = Expect<Equal<t1_actual, t1_expected>>;

const three = createRoute("💨Dasher", "3");
type t2_actual = typeof three; // =>
type t2_expected = "3"; // =>
type t2 = Expect<Equal<t2_actual, t2_expected>>;

// @ts-expect-error
createRoute("🌟Vixen", true);

// @ts-expect-error
createRoute("💃Dancer", [1]);

// @ts-expect-error
createRoute("☄️Comet", { 1: 1 });
