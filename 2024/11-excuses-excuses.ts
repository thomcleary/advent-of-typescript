// Excuses, Excuses

// [Last night, while the reindeer plotted on how to leverage ðŸ’‹Crystal Claus with their knowledge of her affair with ðŸª©Jamie Glitterglum, ðŸ’‹Crystal and ðŸª©Jamie met up in a panic. Today, ðŸŽ…Santa is beginning to suspect something]

// [ðŸŽ…Santa] Dear.. Where were you last night?

// [ðŸ’‹Crystal, turning bright red in embarrassment] Oh. Uh, I was out doing karaoke with some friends.
// Kendrick Lamar and Opeth both released albums on the same day last month, so we've been learning all the songs to both.
// [coughing nervously] Oh [cough] and also we were trying out a new drink one of the elves came up with.
// It's a bit like a mojito but instead of mint it's.. well it's a whole thing.
// Then we also

// [ðŸŽ…Santa] You seem nervous.

// [ðŸ’‹Crystal, sweating] Oh, no, not at all!
// Not at all!
// It's just so hard to remember, you can understand!

// [Later that night ðŸ’‹Crystal and ðŸª©Jamie met again.]

// [ðŸ’‹Crystal] We're in BIG trouble.
// What are we gonna do!!?
// We need a new excuse, and we need to add something to it.
// But... what??

// [ðŸª©Jamie] Talk to him again, but this time be ready to add to your excuse!
// Just bury him in details.
// ðŸŽ…Santa tunes out if you say anything longer than two sentences about non-cookie-related topics.
// Think of a few different excuses, just in case.

// We already have a Excuse that ðŸ’‹Crystal provided ðŸŽ…Santa, but now we need to extend it in some way.
// We need it to be general-purpose, so ðŸ’‹Crystal can try a few different ideas out.

// Answer
type Excuse<T extends Record<PropertyKey, string>> = {
  new (excuses: T): {
    [K in keyof T & string]: `${K}: ${T[K]}`;
  }[keyof T & string];
