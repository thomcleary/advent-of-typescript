// 💋Crystal Panics

// [💋Crystal Claus, 🎅Santa's wife, has been unhappy in her marriage.
// 🎅Santa goes on days-long benders where he's almost impossible to tolerate.
// 💋Crystal has needs too, after all. 🪩Jamie Glitterglum, 💋Crystal's long time friend, has recently made some... advances, and 💋Crystal isn't sure what to do.
// 💋Crystal confides in 🎩Bernard.]

// [💋Crystal] He's gonna kill me, 🎩Bernard.
// Or worse, he’ll leave me stranded at the North Pole with no Wi-Fi and zero prospects.

// [🎩Bernard] Did anything actually happen though?

// [💋Crystal] Well not exactly.........

// [🎩Bernard, looking skeptical] ??

// [💋Crystal] It’s complicated!!
// Things just kinda... escalated over mulled wine and snowman-shaped Jello shots!

// [🎩Bernard] How exactly does one sorta have an affair behind the back of the Patron of Yuletide, himself?
// Did you trip and fall into 🪩Jamie's lap or something?

// [💋Crystal] 🪩Jamie and I haven't quite exactly... well... it's complicated!!

// [🎩Bernard] You better make it less complicated! and soon!
// Although, thankfully it's 🎅Santa we're talkin' about. The guy thinks JSON is a new kind of cookie.

// [💋Crystal] I know exactly what to do.
// 🎅Santa's been super frustrated with the work of those damn reindeer.
// They've been developing this subroutine to create new routes on Christmas night, but it's not working correctly.
// The literal values won't infer like they're supposed to.
// It's close but.... I think if I can fix it, I can keep 🎅Santa from going on another rage-filled tirade.
// I gotta keep him content.

// [🎩Bernard] Then this would mark the first time I’ve seen him not rage-punch a snow globe over the slightest inconvenience.

// Answer
const createRoute = <const Routes extends string[]>(
  author: string,
  route: Routes,
) => ({
  author,
  route,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
});

// Tests
import type { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";

const oneMill = createRoute("💨Dasher", [
  "Atherton",
  "Scarsdale",
  "Cherry Hills Village",
]).route;
type t0_actual = typeof oneMill; // =>
type t0_expected = [
  // =>
  "Atherton",
  "Scarsdale",
  "Cherry Hills Village",
];
type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;

const two = createRoute("🌟Vixen", ["Detroit", "Cleveland", "Dayton"]).route;
type t1_actual = typeof two; // =>
type t1_expected = [
  // =>
  "Detroit",
  "Cleveland",
  "Dayton",
];
type t1 = Expect<Equal<t1_actual, t1_expected>>;
