// ⚡Blitzen Fixes The Mess
//
// [🎅Santa's reindeer,⚡Blitzen, has a secret meeting with 🎩Bernard, the head of the elves after ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher presented 🎅Santa with their a pay increase demand./]
//
// [⚡Blitzen] Did Santa go for it?
// Did he accept our Demand for a pay increase?
//
// [🎩Bernard] Those moron's ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher just wrote down number.
// I told them to write down a number.
//
// [⚡Blitzen] What in the actual F...
//
// [🎩Bernard] I know I know.
// You have to really spell it out for them.
//
// [⚡Blitzen] Alright. I'll take care of it.
// I'll budget 100k for each of us Reindeer.
// That’s enough to cover therapy for pulling Santa’s bloated cheeks across three continents, plus a little left over for a sleigh-side mojito bar.
//
// [🎩Bernard] I swear if I have to hold their hand anymore we're gonna put Reindeer sausage on the menu like the humans in Alaska seem to enjoy so much.
//
// [⚡Blitzen, agast] You realize I'm a reindeer?
// You gotta lay off the powered sugar bro.
//
// [🎩Bernard] Over my dead body.
// It's the only thing that makes me feel good in this nightmare of a job.
//
//
// Yesterday ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher just gave number as their demand to 🎅Santa.
// That's not nearly specific enough.
// We're gonna need something much more specific.
// Look at the tests.
// See what we can change to make them all pass.

// Tests
import type { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";

type t0_actual = Demand; // =>
type t0_expected = 900_000; // =>
type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;

/*
 * Sometimes, throughout Advent of TypeScript, you'll see a test that asserts there _is_ a type error, often to ensure that you're providing a correct implementation.
 * In this example, passing `number` isn't good enough, so we're highlighting that to you by showing that would cause a type error if `number` is the value of `Demand`.
 */

// @ts-expect-error
type e0 = Expect<Equal<Demand, number>>;

// Answer
type Demand = 900_000;
