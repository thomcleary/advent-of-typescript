// 🌟Vixen Confronts 🪩Jamie

// [🪩Jamie] You're lying.
// You didn't see anything because nothing was happening.
// I haven't done anything wrong!

// [🌟Vixen] I literally saw you and 💋Crystal with my own two eyes.
// Would you like me to describe the unicorn tattoo on your left cheek?
// Nice one, by the way.

// [🪩Jamie, sweating] Damn it.
// You did see.
// What are you going to do?

// [🌟Vixen] 🪩Jamie Glitterglum.
// It's not what I am going to do to you but rather what you are going to do for me.

// [🪩Jamie] Huh?

// [🌟Vixen] We've been arguing with Santa about our pay.
// You seem like someone uniquely positioned to help get him to change his mind.

// [🪩Jamie] You absolute jerk!
// You're blackmailing me!

// [🌟Vixen] Look, we all have our own goals.
// Get 💋Crystal to convince him to pay us what we're worth.
// We literally haven't had a pay raise since 2009.
// This shouldn't be so hard, but you know 🎅Santa.
// He could care less about the rest of us.

// [🪩Jamie] Well how am I supposed to do that?

// [🌟Vixen] There's an npm I've been working on, santas-special-list.
// Honestly it’s a mess of untyped spaghetti code and patched dependencies, so good luck with that.
// Let's start there.
// It needs types.
// I was supposed to do it, but I need some cover so I can discuss all this with the other reindeer.
// You make the types for me so I can slip away for a few hours.
// I'll find you tomorrow and let you know what you need to do next.

// [🪩Jamie] I hate you.
// I have always hated you.
// Now I hate you more.

// [🌟Vixen] After what you're about to do for me, I think we're going to be great friends. 🖤

// 🪩Jamie sure is in trouble.
// Help 🪩Jamie do 🌟Vixen's job by making types for the santas-special-list package.
// Things are really heating up in the North Pole!

// Answer
declare module "santas-special-list" {
  export type Status = "naughty" | "nice";
  export type Child = { name: string; status: Status };
  export type List = Child[];
}

// Tests
import type { Expect, Equal } from "type-testing";
import type { Status, Child, List } from "santas-special-list";

type t0_actual = Status; // =>
type t0_expected = "naughty" | "nice"; // =>
type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;

type t1_actual = Child; // =>
type t1_expected = {
  // =>
  name: string;
  status: Status;
};
type t1 = Expect<Equal<t1_actual, t1_expected>>;

type t2_actual = List; // =>
type t2_expected = Child[]; // =>
type t2 = Expect<Equal<t2_actual, t2_expected>>;
