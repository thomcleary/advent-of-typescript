// The Reinder Have Had Enough
//
// [🎅Santa's reindeer, ☄️Comet and 💨Dasher, have a secret meeting with 🎩Bernard, the head of the elves]
//
// [☄️Comet] It's the economy, stupid!
//
// [💨Dasher] ☄️Comet! I'm sick of your shit.
// Read a book or something, wouldja??
// Our productivity far outpaced North Pole's inflation like two decades ago.
// Our wage hasn't changed since 2009 and if you take inflation into account we make half of what we made then!
// We could have the best economy of the last 500 years and it still wouldn't change anything.
//
// [🎩Bernard] Boys, boys! calm down. We'll fix this. We can fix this.
//
// [☄️Comet] Oh, I’m sorry, Mr. Bernard the Keynesian scholar.
// Maybe you can explain why we’re still getting paid in candy canes like it’s 1947.
// Apparently we're dealing with reindeer here [glares at 💨Dasher] that don't even know the difference between any and unknown.
//
// [🎩Bernard] Boys, boys, calm the hell down!
// You’re not the only ones with problems.
// I’ve got 600 elves in the workshop huffing reindeer wax and unionizing over bathroom breaks.
// You just need to come up with a number for our Demand.
//
// [💨Dasher] What kind of number?
//
// [🎩Bernard] At this point, any number will do. But we need to start somewhere.
//
// [💨Dasher] Why not go all in?
// Write down ‘infinity carrots’ and tell him it’s non-negotiable.
// What’s he gonna do, hire reindeer scabs?
//
// [🎩Bernard] Do you know how hard it is to get Santa to focus these days?
// Half the time, he’s passed out in his workshop muttering about crypto and Mrs. Claus’s book club drama.
// ANY number will be fine as a staring point.

// Tests

 * We compare the two results here with `Expect` and `Equal`

type t0 = Expect<Equal<t0_actual, t0_expected>>;

// Answer
type Demand = number;
