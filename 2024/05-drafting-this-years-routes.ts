// Drafting This Year's Routes

// [❤️Cupid and 🌟Vixen are presenting 🎅Santa with their work on the route for this year's Christmas present delivery.]

// [🎅Santa] What is it?
// Are you guys working blindfolded or what!??

// [❤️Cupid] Hardly.
// We've been working on this for weeks and weeks.

// [🎅Santa] What am I even shelling out these beautiful carrots for?
// It's like it's suddenly amateur hour at the North Pole!

// [🌟Vixen] Actually, funny you should raise that point because you pay us for a quality of work far below what we've just provided.
// You should be thrilled.

// [🎅Santa] I don't want any more of that attitude from you, 🌟Vixen.
// I think you should think of the position that puts your colleagues in when you talk like that.
// Should I pay them less just so I can pay you more? Huh?

// [🌟Vixen] I'm getting tired of going around-and-around with you on this.
// Just tell us what you want.

// [🎅Santa] Well for one thing, the route should be should be able to handle any arbitrary input!
// And while you’re at it, make the route solar-powered.
// The PR team says it’s time we went carbon neutral.

// 🎅Santa is hard to please.
// That much is for sure.
// To appease him, we want a function that will accept any input and return a value that has exactly the same type.
